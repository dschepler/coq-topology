This library develops some of the basic concepts and results of general
topology.

The library depends on my ZornsLemma contribution.  The provided
makefile expects compiled files to be present in ../ZornsLemma; if you
have them somewhere else, first run
  coq_makefile -R /path/to/ZornsLemma ZornsLemma -R . Topology *.v > makefile
before running make.
